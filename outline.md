# CODE1161 General Computing Homepage S1 2018

## Course Outline:

This course focuses on using programming as a means of  problem solving, storytelling and creative expression for people in non-computer science fields.
 
Programming is simultaneously a vocational skill, a branch of philosophy, a culture, and the glue that holds the modern world together. By the end of this course you will have the philosophical tools needed to **design solutions and the technical skill** to implement them.

In the same way that being able to hold a pen doesn't make you a writer, being able to type code doesn't make you a programmer. So we'll learn how to manipulate symbols (type code), what those symbols mean, and how to decide which symbols to type in the first place. We'll learn simple logic and strategies for decomposing problems. We'll learn about the history and culture of computers in general, and in art and architecture.

The course will be taught through three sections.
The first will be becoming proficient in the [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).
Second is will be a machine learning project which utilises your newfound problem solving and programming skills.
Third will be a the Open Data Projects: a data analysis and story telling telling task.

## Schedule
### Week 1: Welcome to CODE1161 and Your dev environment

#### Introduction

- **An introduction to the world of computing** as it is in 2018. This should provide some context to what this course aims to teach and why.
