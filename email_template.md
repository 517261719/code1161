# What is this?

It's a template email for you to use so that your issues get dealth with quickly and with minimal back-and-forth. Filling it in carefully will make it so much easier for me to get through lots of emails whlie still giving each of them the attention it deserves.

Another way to think about this is that if you _don't_ fill it in well then you are stealing time away from your peers, and that's not very cool.

# The template

Copy this template, modify it so that it fits your situation and off you go. Because it's in your repo, there are some things that you can change permanantly to save time. E.g. your name will be the same, your repo will be the same etc.
